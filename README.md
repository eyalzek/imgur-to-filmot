#Imgur to Filmot

As simple Chrome extension that changes all links on a webpage that contain imgur links to point to filmot.

Useful if imgur is blocked at your work or school.

Features:
- Supports RES on Reddit (including never ending reddit)
- Rewrites https links to http as filmot doesn't support https (yet!)
- Uses the filmot.com domain which has better ping times

To do:
- Add support for rewriting all links within filmot.com to a filmot.com path
- Whitelist / blacklist sites
- Add button to enable / disable on the fly
- Optionally add other imgur mirror sites manually
